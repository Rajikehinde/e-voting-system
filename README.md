A capstone project on e-voting system

An e-voting system, short for electronic voting system, is a modern and technology-driven approach to conducting elections. It replaces traditional paper-based voting methods with digital platforms that enable voters to cast their ballots electronically. E-voting systems aim to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of elections while maintaining the utmost security and transparency in the democratic process. This innovative technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we vote and participate in democratic decision-making.
